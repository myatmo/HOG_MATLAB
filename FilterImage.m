function [im_filtered] = FilterImage(im, filter)
%Input: im is the gray scale m × n image (Figure 2(a)) converted to double (refer to
%im2double built-in function); filter is a filter (k × k matrix)
%Output: im_filtered is m × n filtered image. You may need to pad zeros on the
%boundary on the input image to get the same size filtered image.
%Description: Given an image and filter, you will compute the filtered image. Given the
%two functions above, you can generate differential images by visualizing the magnitude
%of the filter response as shown in Figure 2(b) and 2(c).
