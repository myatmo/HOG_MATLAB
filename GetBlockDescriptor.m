function ori_histo_normalized = GetBlockDescriptor(ori_histo, block_size)
%Input: ori_histo is the histogram of oriented gradients without normalization. block_size
%is the size of each block (e.g., the number of cells in each row/column), which is a positive integer.
%Output: ori_histo_normalized is the normalized histogram (size: (M?(block_size?
%1)) × (N ? (block_size ? 1)) × (6 × block_size2).
%Description: To account for changes in illumination and contrast, the gradient strengths
%must be locally normalized, which requires grouping the cells together into larger, spatially connected blocks (adjacent cells). Given the histogram of oriented gradients, you
%apply L2 normalization as follow
