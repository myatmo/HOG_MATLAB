function [filter_x, filter_y] = GetDifferentialFilter(kernel)
%Input: none.
%Output: filter_x and filter_y are 3×3 filters that differentiate along x and y directions, respectively.
%Description: You will compute the gradient by differentiating the image along x and
%y directions. This code will output the differential filters.
